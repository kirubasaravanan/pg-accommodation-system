## Extending & Best Practices
- **Component-based UI:** All major dashboard features are split into focused components (see `src/pages/` and `src/components/`).
- **Scoped CSS:** Use CSS modules (e.g., `AdminDashboard.module.css`) for maintainable, conflict-free styles.
- **Add new features:** Create new components in `src/components/` and import them into the relevant page/tab.
- **API endpoints:** Update or add Express routes/controllers in `backend/` as needed.
- **Environment variables:** Store secrets (like DB URIs) in `.env` (never commit this file).

---

## Scripts & Utilities
- Backend seeding: `backend/seed.js`, `populateRooms.js`, `populateTenants.js`, etc.
- Admin user creation: `backend/createAdminUser.js`
- Booking utilities: `backend/populateBookings.js`, `printBookings.js`

## Future Enhancements

### User Management
- **Password Reset Functionality**: Currently, passwords are set at creation or update, but there's no dedicated "reset password" flow.
- **More Granular Role Permissions**: Depending on your application's needs, you might want to define what each role can and cannot do more explicitly.
- **User Profile Pictures/Avatars**: If relevant.
- **Activity Logs for Users**: Tracking user actions.
- **Bulk Actions**: E.g., deleting multiple users at once.
- **Search/Filter Users**: For larger user lists.
